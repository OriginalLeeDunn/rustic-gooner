# Block Interaction Feature Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the block interaction system implemented in the voxel game client. The system allows players to target, break, and place blocks in the voxel world, with visual feedback and proper chunk boundary handling.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Block Targeting
- Raycasting from camera position using DDA algorithm for efficient voxel traversal
- Visual highlighting of targeted blocks with a translucent wireframe cube
- Proper handling of maximum raycast distance

### 2. Block Breaking
- Left-click to break (set to air) the currently targeted block
- Automatic chunk mesh regeneration after block modification
- Entity component updates to reflect visual changes

### 3. Block Placement
- Right-click to place a block adjacent to the targeted face
- Intelligent handling of chunk boundaries when placing blocks
- Support for different block types (selectable via number keys)
- Automatic chunk creation when placing blocks at chunk boundaries

### 4. User Interface
- Block type selection via number keys (1, 2, 3)
- Visual feedback for targeted blocks
- Cursor lock state respecting for interaction control

## Code Structure

The block interaction system is organized as follows:

- `src/voxel/block_interaction.rs`: Main implementation of block targeting and interaction systems
- `src/voxel/raycast.rs`: DDA-based raycasting algorithm for efficient block targeting
- `src/voxel/chunk.rs`: Chunk data structure with methods for block manipulation and mesh generation
- `src/main.rs`: System registration and integration with the main game loop

## Testing Plan

### Manual Testing

1. **Block Targeting Test**
   - Launch the game client
   - Move around and verify that blocks are highlighted correctly when targeted
   - Check that the highlight appears on the correct face of the block
   - Verify maximum raycast distance works as expected

2. **Block Breaking Test**
   - Target a block and left-click to break it
   - Verify the block is removed from the world
   - Check that the chunk mesh is updated correctly
   - Test breaking blocks at chunk boundaries
   - Verify performance remains stable when breaking multiple blocks

3. **Block Placing Test**
   - Target a position and right-click to place a block
   - Verify the block is added to the world with the correct type
   - Check that the chunk mesh is updated correctly
   - Test placing blocks at chunk boundaries

4. **Block Type Selection Test**
   - Press number keys 1, 2, and 3 to select different block types
   - Place blocks and verify they have the correct appearance

### Automated Testing

1. **Raycast Tests**
   - Test raycast hits on blocks in a simple chunk
   - Test raycast misses when no blocks are in the path
   - Test raycast behavior at chunk boundaries

2. **Block Interaction Tests**
   - Test block targeting with different ray directions
   - Test block breaking and updating chunk data
   - Test block placing and updating chunk data
   - Test block type selection logic

3. **Block Placement Test**
   - Target a surface and right-click to place a block
   - Verify the block appears in the correct position
   - Test placing blocks across chunk boundaries
   - Verify new chunks are created when needed
   - Test different block types using number keys

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Test interaction when no block is targeted (should do nothing)
   - Test interaction when cursor is unlocked (should do nothing)
   - Test at world boundaries and extreme coordinates
   - Test rapid breaking/placing for stability

### Automated Testing

Create the following test files:

1. **Unit Tests for Raycast Algorithm**
   - File: `src/voxel/tests/raycast_tests.rs`
   - Test simple ray hits in different directions
   - Test rays that miss all blocks
   - Test rays at chunk boundaries
   - Test maximum distance cutoff

2. **Unit Tests for Block Interaction**
   - File: `src/voxel/tests/block_interaction_tests.rs`
   - Mock camera and input systems
   - Test block breaking logic
   - Test block placing logic
   - Test chunk boundary handling

3. **Integration Tests**
   - File: `tests/block_interaction_integration_tests.rs`
   - Test the full interaction pipeline
   - Verify system interactions work correctly
